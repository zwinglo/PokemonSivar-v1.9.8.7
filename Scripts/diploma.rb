# * Diploma - by FL (Credits will be apreciated)
#===============================================================================
#
# This script is for Pokémon Essentials. It displays a game diploma like in
# official games. This is a very simple scene that I made with a lot of comments
# that can be used to understand how simple scenes work.
#
#== INSTALLATION ===============================================================
#
# To this script works, put it above main.
#
#== HOW TO USE =================================================================
#
# To show the diploma use 'pbDiploma(main_text,image_path)' where the main_text
# is the diploma main text and the image_path is the path of the diploma picture
# (like "Graphics/Pictures/diploma").
#
# If you call it without parameters (only 'pbDiploma') then the default main
# text and image path are used.
#
#== NOTES ======================================================================
#
# I suggest to call this script with the conditional branch: 
# '$player.pokedex.owned_count==GameData::Species.species_count'
# ('$Trainer.pokedexOwned==PBSpecies.maxValue' in older Essentials). You can
# also use '$player.pokedex.owned_count(pbGetPokedexRegion)' instead of 
# '$player.pokedex.owned_count' for current regional pokédex.
# 
#===============================================================================

# Check's if PluginManager is defined. The "defined?" return false on Essentials
# v17 and before, so it won't call an undefined class if this script is used on
# these Essentials versions.
# If PluginManager exists, checks if plugin is already installed to won't
# register it twice.
